# Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

Infrastructure-as-a-Service is the foundational layer of cloud computing, providing virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS providers manage the physical infrastructure while customers manage everything from the operating system up.

## Overview

IaaS abstracts physical hardware into programmable, scalable resources:

- **Compute**: Virtual machines, containers, serverless functions
- **Storage**: Block storage, object storage, file systems
- **Networking**: Virtual networks, load balancers, CDNs, DNS
- **Security**: Firewalls, identity management, encryption

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Pricing Model** | Pay-per-use (compute hours, GB stored, data transfer) |
| **Capital Intensity** | Very high - data centers, hardware, power, cooling |
| **Margins** | 15-30% gross margins typical |
| **Moat** | Scale economics, geographic coverage, ecosystem |
| **Sales Motion** | Developer-first, bottom-up, usage-based growth |

## Market Examples

### Hyperscalers
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** - Market leader, broadest service offering
- **Microsoft Azure** - Enterprise integration, hybrid cloud
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Data/ML strengths, Kubernetes native

### Specialized Players
- **DigitalOcean** - Developer-focused simplicity
- **Vultr** - High-performance compute
- **Hetzner** - European, price-competitive
- **OVHcloud** - European data sovereignty

### Edge/Niche
- **Cloudflare** - Edge compute + CDN
- **Fly.io** - Edge-native applications
- **Lambda Labs** - GPU cloud for AI

## Economics

### Unit Economics
```
Revenue = Σ (Resource Usage × Price per Unit)

Key Metrics:
- Revenue per server
- Data center utilization rate
- Cost per compute hour
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Net revenue retention (NRR)
```

### Cost Structure
- **Capital**: Data center construction, servers, networking equipment
- **Operating**: Power, cooling, bandwidth, personnel
- **Maintenance**: Hardware replacement, upgrades
- **Sales**: Typically low-touch, self-serve dominated

## Building an IaaS Startup

### When IaaS Makes Sense
- You have access to unique infrastructure (locations, hardware, capacity)
- You can specialize deeply in a vertical (GPU, edge, compliance)
- You can offer 10x better developer experience on a subset of use cases

### Challenges
- **Capital requirements**: Data centers and hardware require significant upfront investment
- **Hyperscaler competition**: AWS/Azure/GCP have massive scale advantages
- **Commoditization**: Computing is increasingly commodity; differentiation is hard
- **Talent**: Requires specialized infrastructure and reliability engineering

### Success Patterns
1. **Specialize**: Don't compete with AWS on breadth; go deep on one thing
2. **Developer experience**: Make it 10x simpler for your specific use case
3. **Pricing innovation**: Usage-based, spot markets, reserved capacity
4. **Geographic arbitrage**: Serve underserved regions or compliance needs
5. **Vertical focus**: Build for specific workloads (AI, gaming, streaming)
