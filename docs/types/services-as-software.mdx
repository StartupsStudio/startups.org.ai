description: AI-delivered work outcomes, from digital employees to productized services

# Services-as-Software

Services-as-Software represents a fundamental shift in how work gets done. Instead of software that helps humans do work (SaaS), AI systems do the work directly, delivering outcomes rather than tools.

## The Services-as-Software Paradigm

Traditional software automates tasks. Services-as-Software delivers outcomes:

| Traditional | Services-as-Software |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Software helps you write | AI writes for you |
| Tools for data analysis | AI analyzes and recommends |
| Workflow automation | Complete task execution |
| User does the work | AI does the work |

### Why Now?

The convergence of large language models, multimodal AI, and agentic systems makes it possible to deliver services that previously required human expertise:

- **Language understanding**: AI can interpret complex instructions
- **Reasoning**: AI can plan and execute multi-step tasks
- **Tool use**: AI can operate software, APIs, and external systems
- **Adaptation**: AI learns from feedback and improves

## Two Delivery Models

Services-as-Software manifests in two primary patterns:

### 1. Agents as Digital Workers

AI systems that function like employees or contractors:
- Assigned roles and responsibilities
- Work autonomously on tasks
- Communicate and coordinate
- Improve with experience

### 2. Productized Services

Packaged AI services with defined inputs, outputs, and pricing:
- Specific scope and deliverables
- Predictable turnaround
- Transparent pricing
- No interaction required

## Model 1: Agents as Digital Workers

AI agents function as digital employees or contractors, taking on roles traditionally filled by humans.

### Agent Archetypes

| Role | What They Do | Example Companies |
|------|--------------|-------------------|
| **SDR Agent** | Research, qualify, and reach out to prospects | 11x, AiSDR, Regie.ai |
| **Customer Support Agent** | Handle tickets, answer questions, escalate issues | Intercom Fin, Sierra, Decagon |
| **Research Agent** | Gather information, synthesize reports | Elicit, Perplexity |
| **Code Agent** | Write, review, and refactor code | GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Devin |
| **Legal Agent** | Draft documents, review contracts | Harvey, Spellbook |
| **Finance Agent** | Bookkeeping, analysis, reporting | Puzzle, Pilot |
| **Recruiting Agent** | Source candidates, screen resumes | HireVue, Paradox |
| **Marketing Agent** | Create content, manage campaigns | Jasper, Copy.ai |

### Agent Characteristics

```
Digital Worker Properties:
├── Identity: Name, role, capabilities
├── Knowledge: Domain expertise, company context
├── Tools: APIs, databases, applications it can use
├── Autonomy: What it can do without approval
├── Escalation: When and how it involves humans
└── Learning: How it improves from feedback
```

### Agent Economics

The unit economics of AI agents vs. human workers:

| Factor | Human Worker | AI Agent |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **Cost** | $50-150K/year salary + benefits | $500-5,000/month |
| **Availability** | 40 hours/week | 24/7/365 |
| **Scalability** | Hiring takes months | Instant provisioning |
| **Consistency** | Variable performance | Consistent (with variance) |
| **Learning** | Training takes time | Immediate updates |
| **Flexibility** | Can handle ambiguity | Bounded by capabilities |

- What do alternatives charge?
- Is there pricing power in your category?
- How differentiated is your offering?

### 4. Unit Economics
- What are your marginal costs?
- How does pricing align with your costs?
- What margin do you need at scale?
