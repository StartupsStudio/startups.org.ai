# Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

Software-as-a-Service is the dominant model for delivering business software. SaaS companies build applications that run in the cloud, accessed via browser or API, and charge recurring subscription fees.

## Overview

SaaS delivers complete applications:

- **Application Layer**: User interfaces, workflows, features
- **Business Logic**: Rules, automation, integrations
- **Data Storage**: Customer data managed by the provider
- **Updates**: Continuous delivery of new features
- **Support**: Customer success, training, documentation

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Pricing Model** | Per-seat, per-usage, or tiered subscriptions |
| **Capital Intensity** | Low-medium - mostly engineering and go-to-market |
| **Margins** | 70-85% gross margins |
| **Moat** | Workflow integration, data lock-in, network effects |
| **Sales Motion** | PLG (product-led) or sales-led, depending on ACV |

## Economics

### The SaaS Metrics Stack

```
Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)
├── New ARR (new customers)
├── Expansion ARR (upsells, cross-sells)
├── Contraction ARR (downgrades)
└── Churned ARR (lost customers)

Net Revenue Retention (NRR) = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting ARR
```

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Good | Great | Elite |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| **Gross Margin** | >70% | >80% | >85% |
| **NRR** | >100% | >120% | >130% |
| **CAC Payback** | <24mo | <18mo | <12mo |
| **LTV:CAC** | >3:1 | >5:1 | >7:1 |
| **Magic Number** | >0.5 | >0.75 | >1.0 |

### Rule of 40
```
Growth Rate + Profit Margin ≥ 40%

Examples:
- 50% growth + -10% margin = 40% ✓
- 30% growth + 15% margin = 45% ✓
- 20% growth + 10% margin = 30% ✗
```

## Building a SaaS Startup

### When SaaS Makes Sense
- There's a recurring workflow you can improve 10x
- Customers will pay monthly/annually for value delivered
- You can achieve product-market fit before running out of capital
- The market is large enough to support multiple players

### Challenges
- **Competition**: SaaS markets tend toward winner-take-most dynamics
- **Distribution**: CAC is rising across most channels
- **Retention**: Churn compounds negatively over time
- **Feature parity**: Competitors copy features quickly

### Success Patterns

1. **Product-led growth**: Build virality and self-serve into the product
2. **Vertical focus**: Own a specific industry or use case
3. **Platform/ecosystem**: Build integrations and marketplace
4. **Customer success obsession**: Churn is the silent killer
5. **Land and expand**: Small entry, grow within accounts

## SaaS Pricing Models

### Per-Seat
```
Most common for collaboration tools
Pro: Simple, predictable
Con: Creates friction for adoption
```

### Usage-Based
```
Charge for consumption (API calls, data processed, messages sent)
Pro: Aligns cost with value
Con: Revenue volatility
```

### Tiered
```
Free → Pro → Business → Enterprise
Pro: Captures different willingness to pay
Con: Feature allocation decisions are hard
```

### Flat-Rate
```
Single price for unlimited use
Pro: Simple to understand
Con: Leaves money on table
```

## The SaaS Growth Playbook

### Stage 1: Product-Market Fit
- Find 10 customers who love you
- Manual onboarding and support
- Talk to users constantly
- Focus on retention over growth

### Stage 2: Go-to-Market Fit
- Repeatable sales motion
- Predictable unit economics
- Clear ICP definition
- Scalable acquisition channels

### Stage 3: Scale
- Expand team and operations
- Multi-product or platform strategy
- International expansion
- Enterprise motion

## Product-Led Growth (PLG)

PLG is the dominant modern SaaS motion:

```
Free/Trial Users
     ↓
Activation (first value moment)
     ↓
Engagement (habit formation)
     ↓
Conversion (paid upgrade)
     ↓
Expansion (add seats, upgrade tier)
     ↓
Referral (invite teammates)
```

### PLG Metrics
- **Activation rate**: % who reach first value
- **Free-to-paid conversion**: ~3-5% typical
- **Time to value**: How quickly users succeed
- **Viral coefficient**: Referrals per user
