# Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)

Data-as-a-Service businesses monetize access to data through APIs, feeds, or managed data products. DaaS companies aggregate, clean, enrich, or generate data that customers need but cannot efficiently produce themselves.

## Overview

DaaS encompasses several models:

- **Data Aggregation**: Collecting and normalizing data from multiple sources
- **Data Enrichment**: Adding value to existing data (e.g., company info from email)
- **Data Generation**: Creating original datasets through collection or synthesis
- **Data APIs**: Programmatic access to real-time or reference data
- **Data Marketplaces**: Platforms for buying/selling datasets

### Key Characteristics

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Pricing Model** | API calls, records accessed, subscription tiers |
| **Capital Intensity** | Medium - data acquisition, processing infrastructure |
| **Margins** | 60-80% gross margins (after data acquisition) |
| **Moat** | Data exclusivity, network effects, integration depth |
| **Sales Motion** | Developer-first or enterprise sales, depending on data type |

## Economics

### Unit Economics
```
Revenue = Σ (API Calls × Price per Call) + Subscription Fees

Key Metrics:
- API call volume and growth
- Revenue per API call
- Data freshness/accuracy metrics
- Customer integration depth
- Net revenue retention
```

### Cost Structure
- **Data acquisition**: Licensing, scraping, partnerships, user contributions
- **Infrastructure**: Storage, compute, API serving
- **Data quality**: Cleaning, validation, enrichment
- **Compliance**: Privacy, data rights, security

## Building a DaaS Startup

### When DaaS Makes Sense
- You have unique access to valuable data
- You can aggregate data others cannot efficiently gather
- There's high willingness to pay for data-driven decisions
- Network effects can make your data better over time

### Challenges
- **Data moats erode**: Competitors can often acquire similar data
- **Privacy regulations**: GDPR, CCPA create compliance overhead
- **Quality maintenance**: Data requires constant updates and validation
- **Customer concentration**: Large customers often have negotiating power

### Success Patterns

1. **Data network effects**: More customers = better data (Plaid model)
2. **Integration depth**: Become embedded in customer workflows
3. **Proprietary collection**: Data no one else can access
4. **Real-time advantage**: Fresh data commands premium pricing
5. **Compliance as moat**: Build for regulated industries

## DaaS Pricing Models

### API-Based
```
Free Tier: 1,000 calls/month
Growth: $99/month for 10,000 calls
Scale: $499/month for 100,000 calls
Enterprise: Custom pricing, volume discounts
```

### Record-Based
```
Pay per enriched record
Volume discounts at thresholds
Subscription for unlimited lookups
```

### Outcome-Based
```
Pay for matched/found records only
Success-fee pricing
Value-based for high-stakes data
```

## Data Quality Metrics

Key quality dimensions to track:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Accuracy** | % of data points that are correct | >95% |
| **Completeness** | % of fields populated | >80% |
| **Freshness** | Age of most recent update | <30 days |
| **Match Rate** | % of queries that return data | >70% |
| **Consistency** | Data format standardization | >99% |

## The Data Flywheel

Best DaaS businesses create data flywheels:

```
More Customers
     ↓
More Data Usage
     ↓
Better Data Quality
     ↓
Higher Value to Customers
     ↓
More Customers
```

### Building the Flywheel
1. **User contributions**: Customers help validate/correct data
2. **Usage signals**: Query patterns reveal data demand
3. **Network effects**: Each integration improves the dataset
4. **Compound enrichment**: Combine multiple data sources
