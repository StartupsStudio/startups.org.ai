# Digital Startup Business Models

Understanding the different types of digital business models is fundamental to building a successful startup. Each model has distinct characteristics, economics, and go-to-market strategies.

## The *-as-a-Service Stack

Digital business models can be visualized as a stack, with each layer building on the one below:

| Layer | Model | What You Sell | Examples |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Infrastructure** | IaaS | Compute, storage, networking | AWS EC2, GCP, Azure VMs |
| **Platform** | PaaS | Runtime environments, managed services | Heroku, Vercel, Railway |
| **Data** | DaaS | Structured data access, APIs | Bloomberg, Clearbit, Twilio |
| **Software** | SaaS | Applications and workflows | Salesforce, Slack, Notion |
| **AI-Delivered Services** | Services-as-Software | Work outcomes, delivered by AI | Harvey, Jasper, Runway |

## Key Differentiators

### Value Capture Position
- **Lower stack** (IaaS/PaaS): Commodity pricing, high volume, thin margins
- **Upper stack** (SaaS/Services-as-Software): Value-based pricing, stickier customers, higher margins

### Customer Acquisition
- **Lower stack**: Developer-focused, bottom-up adoption, usage-based
- **Upper stack**: Business-focused, top-down sales, outcome-based

### Competitive Dynamics
- **Lower stack**: Scale economies, infrastructure investments
- **Upper stack**: Network effects, data moats, workflow integration

## Choosing Your Model

When selecting a business model, consider:

1. **Your unfair advantage** - What do you have that others don't?
2. **Market maturity** - Emerging vs. established markets
3. **Capital requirements** - Infrastructure-heavy vs. asset-light
4. **Time to revenue** - Transaction-based vs. long sales cycles
5. **Defensibility** - How do you build moats?
