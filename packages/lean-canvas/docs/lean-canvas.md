## The 9 Blocks

### 1. Problem

**What it captures:** The top 1-3 problems your customers face.

**Key elements:**
- List your top 3 problems
- Identify existing alternatives (how do customers solve this today?)

**Questions to answer:**
- What problem are you solving?
- How painful is this problem?
- How do people currently deal with it?

**Example:**
```
Problems:
1. Manual contract review takes 10+ hours
2. Errors in contracts lead to legal risk
3. No visibility into contract status

Existing Alternatives:
- Junior lawyers doing manual review
- Expensive law firms
- Spreadsheet tracking
```

---

### 2. Customer Segments

**What it captures:** Who has this problem? Who will pay?

**Key elements:**
- Target customer description
- Early adopter characteristics

**Why early adopters matter:**
- They have the problem acutely
- They're actively seeking solutions
- They'll forgive rough edges
- They'll give valuable feedback

**Example:**
```
Segments:
- Corporate legal teams at companies with 500+ employees
- Legal ops managers

Early Adopters:
- Legal teams reviewing 100+ contracts/month
- Recently experienced a contract-related incident
- Budget authority and tech-forward mindset
```

---

### 3. Unique Value Proposition

**What it captures:** Why you're different and worth paying attention to.

**Key elements:**
- Clear, compelling headline
- High-level concept (X for Y)
- Differentiator

**Formula:**
```
[End result customer wants] + [Specific time period] + [Address objections]
```

**Example:**
```
Headline: "Review contracts 80% faster with AI"
High-Level Concept: "Grammarly for legal contracts"
Differentiator: "First AI trained specifically on legal documents"
```

---

### 4. Solution

**What it captures:** Top 3 features that solve the problems.

**Important:** Don't build features until you've validated the problem.

**Map solutions to problems:**
```
Problem 1: Manual review takes too long
→ Solution: AI-powered contract analysis

Problem 2: Errors lead to legal risk
→ Solution: Clause risk detection

Problem 3: No visibility into status
→ Solution: Contract dashboard
```

---

### 5. Channels

**What it captures:** How you'll reach customers.

**Channel types:**
- **Organic:** Content, SEO, community, word-of-mouth
- **Paid:** Ads, sponsorships, affiliates
- **Partner:** Integrations, resellers, co-marketing

**For startups:** Focus on ONE channel first.

**Example:**
```
Organic: Legal tech conferences, LinkedIn content
Paid: LinkedIn ads to legal ops managers
Partner: Integration with existing CLM tools
Recommended: Start with conferences for high-touch sales
```

---

### 6. Revenue Streams

**What it captures:** How you'll make money.

**Key elements:**
- Revenue model (subscription, transactional, etc.)
- Pricing tiers
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Path to break-even

**Common models:**
- SaaS subscription
- Usage-based pricing
- Marketplace/transaction fee
- Freemium

**Example:**
```
Model: SaaS subscription
Pricing:
- Starter: $500/mo (50 contracts)
- Professional: $1,500/mo (200 contracts)
- Enterprise: Custom

LTV: $18,000 (18-month average tenure × $1,000 avg MRR)
Break-even: 18 months at current burn
```

---

### 7. Cost Structure

**What it captures:** Costs to operate the business.

**Key elements:**
- Fixed costs (salaries, rent, software)
- Variable costs (hosting, support per customer)
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Monthly burn rate

**Example:**
```
Fixed:
- Engineering team: $50K/mo
- Infrastructure: $5K/mo
- Tools/software: $2K/mo

Variable:
- Cloud compute per customer: $20/mo
- Support time: $30/customer/mo

CAC: $2,000
Burn Rate: $65K/mo
```

---

### 8. Key Metrics

**What it captures:** Numbers that tell you if you're winning.

**AARRR Framework (Pirate Metrics):**

| Stage | Question | Metrics |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Acquisition** | How do users find you? | Visitors, signups, CAC |
| **Activation** | Do they have a great first experience? | Activation rate, time to value |
| **Retention** | Do they come back? | Churn, DAU/MAU, NPS |
| **Revenue** | Do they pay? | MRR, ARPU, LTV |
| **Referral** | Do they tell others? | NPS, viral coefficient |

**Example:**
```
Acquisition: Website visitors, demo requests
Activation: % who upload first contract
Retention: Monthly active users, churn rate
Revenue: MRR, expansion revenue
Referral: NPS score, customer referrals
```

---

### 9. Unfair Advantage

**What it captures:** Something that can't be easily copied or bought.

**Real unfair advantages:**
- Insider information
- Expert endorsements
- Dream team
- Personal authority
- Network effects
- Community
- Existing customers
- SEO ranking
- Proprietary data

**Not unfair advantages:**
- Features (can be copied)
- First mover (not defensible)
- Being passionate (not unique)

**Example:**
```
Advantage: Proprietary training dataset of 10M legal documents
Defensibility: Took 3 years to build, requires legal partnerships
Compounding: Model improves with each contract reviewed
```

## Using Lean Canvas

### When to Use It

- **Ideation:** Capture initial business ideas
- **Communication:** Explain your business in 1 page
- **Iteration:** Update as you learn
- **Comparison:** Evaluate pivot options

### Update Frequency

- Early stage: Weekly
- Product-market fit search: Every 2 weeks
- Growth stage: Monthly

### Common Mistakes

1. **Spending too long on it** - It should take 20 minutes
2. **Treating it as final** - It's a living document
3. **Not validating** - Canvas ≠ validated business
4. **Building before validating problem** - Talk to customers first
