# The StoryBrand Framework

Understanding the 7-part StoryBrand framework developed by Donald Miller.

## Overview

StoryBrand is based on the universal story structure found in movies, books, and myths. It positions your **customer as the hero** and your **brand as the guide**.

## 1. The Hero (Your Customer)

**The customer is the hero, not your brand.**

The hero has:
- An **identity** - Who they are
- A **desire** - What they want

### Good Example
```
Identity: "Marketing managers at B2B SaaS companies"
Desire: "Generate qualified leads without spending all day on content"
```

### Common Mistake
Making your brand the hero: "We are the leading provider of..."

---

## 2. The Problem (The Villain)

Every hero faces a problem. In StoryBrand, problems exist on three levels:

### External Problem
The tangible, surface-level issue.
```
"Creating content takes 20+ hours per week"
```

### Internal Problem
The emotional frustration.
```
"Feeling overwhelmed and falling behind competitors"
```

### Philosophical Problem
Why this situation is simply wrong.
```
"Great companies shouldn't struggle to tell their story"
```

### The Villain
The problem should feel like a villain to defeat:
- Time waste
- Complexity
- Missed opportunities
- Outdated processes

---

## 3. The Guide (Your Brand)

**Your brand is the guide, not the hero.**

The guide demonstrates two qualities:

### Empathy
Show you understand their struggle:
```
"We know what it's like to stare at a blank page while deadlines loom"
```

### Authority
Prove you can help:
```
"Trusted by 10,000+ marketers. Featured in Forbes. SOC2 certified."
```

### Guide Archetypes
- The Mentor (wise advisor)
- The Expert (proven track record)
- The Ally (we've been there)

---

## 4. The Plan

Heroes need a clear path. Give them 3-4 simple steps:

### Process Plan
```
1. Connect your data sources
2. Set your goals
3. Get AI-generated content
4. Review and publish
```

### Agreement Plan
Reduce risk with promises:
```
"30-day money-back guarantee"
"No long-term contracts"
"Free migration support"
```

### Plan Names
Give your plan a memorable name:
- "The 3-Step Content System"
- "The Growth Playbook"
- "The Fast-Track Method"

---

## 5. Call to Action

### Direct CTA
The primary action you want them to take:
```
"Start Free Trial"
"Get Started"
"Book a Demo"
```

### Transitional CTA
A lower-commitment option:
```
"Download Free Guide"
"Watch Demo Video"
"See Pricing"
```

### CTA Guidelines
- Be specific ("Start Free Trial" > "Learn More")
- Create urgency when appropriate
- Reduce friction

---

## 6. Success

Paint a picture of what life looks like after they succeed:

### The Transformation
```
Before: "Overwhelmed marketer struggling with content"
After: "Confident leader with a content engine running on autopilot"
```

### Specific Outcomes
```
- "10x more content output"
- "50% reduction in time spent writing"
- "3x increase in qualified leads"
```

### Success Categories
- Status: How they're perceived
- Completeness: What they've achieved
- Self-acceptance: How they feel about themselves

---

## 7. Failure

What's at stake if they don't act?

### Consequences
```
- "Continue falling behind competitors"
- "Waste thousands on ineffective marketing"
- "Miss your growth targets"
```

### Emotional Cost
```
"The stress of never having enough content won't go away on its own"
```

### Using Failure Effectively
- Don't be manipulative
- Be honest about real consequences
- Balance with success messaging (80% success, 20% failure)

---
